## Welcome

Started this off from **mjhea0/flask-boilerplate**,
but in the end it changed so much it is completely a different look and workflow.

### What i changed from the start

* Removing the old useless boiler app, referring only to the updated version
* Using python 3.4
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images/[compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to easily clone the environment
* Removing the fancy stuff/bloatware
* Switching to [Bootstrap 4](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) (n.b. which is *alpha* at the moment)

### What i already added

* WTF forms
* SQLalchemy postgres models and db
* [WTForms alchemy](https://wtforms-alchemy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) plugin, to **convert sqlalchemy models into working WTF forms**!!!
* Customization of base forms

### What i am still missing

* Flask session, cookies and cache
* Flask security
* Documentation

## Instructions for running

To be added (soon).
