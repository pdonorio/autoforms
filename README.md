# autoforms

**Automatic forms on-top of Flask web interface based on SQL models**

*Basic idea*:
> A cleaner bootstrap interface with users, login and registration with a PostgreSQL.

* My thoughts raised from [the flask snippet](http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/60/);
* Forking also the [boilerplate](https://github.com/mjhea0/flask-boilerplate) from **real python** guys;
* Taking a look at the wtfforms in python [which have extension for sqlalchemy](http://wtforms.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ext.html#module-wtforms.ext.sqlalchemy);
* I may test here also the [flask potion](http://potion.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) just for fun.
